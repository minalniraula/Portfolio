# NYC Yellow Taxi Analysis
**Description:** This project analyses NYC Yellow Taxi trip data (July 2021) using Microsoft Excel to demonstrate practical business and data analysis skills. The focus is on answering realistic operational and customer-focused questions using pivot tables, KPIs, charts, and slicers. The analysis covers demand patterns across time and location, trip duration and revenue distribution, and customer payment and tipping behaviour. The final output consists of interactive dashboards built with pivot tables, charts, and slicers to support exploratory analysis.

**Tools used:** This project uses Microsoft Excel with utilising data skills in Excel such as:
  - Power Query (data cleaning and creating custom columns)
  - Power Pivot (data modelling and relationships)
  - DAX measures (KPIs and new measures)
  - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
  - Slicers
