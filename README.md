# Portfolio

Hi! I am Minal. Welcome to my portfolio.

I am a recent graduate entering the analytics space, with a background in digital marketing and content creation, including experience in ghostwriting analytical blog articles. My academic and professional interests lie in transforming raw data into clear, structured insights that support decision-making, particularly through analytical reporting and data visualisation.

With a background in marketing, I approach data with both analytical and creative perspective. I view data visualisation not only as a tool for insight but also as a means of effective communication. Alongside my formal education, I am largely self-taught in areas such as web development and video editing, which I believe reflects a strong capacity for independent learning and adaptability.

This portfolio showcases my early analytics projects, focusing on problem-solving and continuous skill development as I grow within the field.

## Projects
  ### E-commerce Marketing Funnel Analysis
  
  **Link:** [`E-commerce Marketing Funnel Analysis`](https://github.com/minalniraula/Portfolio/blob/main/Ecommerce%20Marketing%20Funnel/README.md)
  
  **Tools:** SQL and Power BI
  
  **Skill used:** 
  - *SQL:* Joins, Aggregate Functions, GROUP BY, CASE Statements, Date & Time Filtering, Data Type Casting, NULL Handling, CREATE TABLE / CREATE VIEW.
  - *Power BI:* Data import, calculated measures, KPI visualisation, funnel and bar charts, and basic formatting.
  
  **Description:**
  This project analyses a multi-CSV e-commerce dataset to construct a sequential signup-to-purchase marketing funnel. Using cleaned transactional and event data, the     analysis tracks how users progress through key funnel stages and identifies where drop-offs occur after signup.
  
   **Results:**
   - The signup-to-purchase conversion rate is approximately 51%.
   - The largest user drop-off occurs between the desire and action stages, indicating friction at the final purchase step.
   - Earlier funnel stages show relatively higher retention, suggesting that user intent is established before checkout.
   
  ### Car Business Performance Dashboard
  
  **Link:** [`Car Business Performance Dashboard`](https://github.com/minalniraula/Portfolio/blob/main/Car%20Business%20Performance/README.md)
  
  **Tools:** Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public
  
  **Skill used:** Calculated fields, aggregations, IF/CASE logic, date and string functions, table calculations, filters and parameters, geographic mapping, dashboard actions and KPI design.
  
  **Description:** For this project, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyse an US based car company’s performance across sales, products, customers, and employees, from their 7 year sales CSV. This dashboard can be used by stakeholders to monitor KPIs, compare employee performance, and identify key drivers of revenue and profitability with filters of car models and regions throughout year 2018 to 2024.
  
  **Results:**
  - Made it easy to identify high and low performing states, employees and car models by sales and profitability using dynamic filters.
  - Highlighted yearly product performance trends, enabling quick assessment of growth or decline across regions.
  - Provided a clear segmented view of customer age along with dynamic filters of car models and states.
  - Supported decision-making by creating employee performance dashboard.
### NYC Yellow Cab Analysis

**Link:** [`NYC Yellow Cab Analysis`](https://github.com/minalniraula/Portfolio/tree/main/NYC%20Yellow%20Cab%20Analysis)

**Tools:** Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables & Charts)

**Skills Used:** Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query), star schema data modelling, DAX measures, calculated fields, aggregations, duration binning, date and time analysis, slicers, KPI design, and interactive dashboard building.

**Description:** For this project, I built an interactive Excel dashboard to analyse NYC Yellow Taxi trip data (July 2021). The analysis focuses on operational performance, demand patterns, trip duration and revenue distribution, and customer payment and tipping behaviour. Using Power Query for data preparation and Power Pivot for modelling and KPI calculations, the dashboard allows stakeholders to monitor key metrics and explore patterns dynamically using filters for borough and time of day.

**Results:**
- Enabled quick identification of peak demand days, times, and boroughs using interactive slicers.
- Highlighted differences between high-volume and high-revenue trip durations.
- Revealed clear behavioural differences in tipping patterns across payment methods and time periods.
- Provided an at-a-glance KPI overview of total trips, revenue, average revenue per trip, and tip percentage to support performance monitoring.
