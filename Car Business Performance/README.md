# Car Business Performance Dashboard

**Description:** This project focuses on analysing the performance of a car company using a large transactional and multi-year sales dataset. I built a structured Tableau dashboard suite to explore sales performance, product profitability, customer demographics, and employee contribution across different states, years, and car models.

**Tools used:** Tableau Public Desktop and published on Tableau Public.

**Skills:** Designed and published interactive Tableau dashboards using calculated fields, date and string functions, aggregations, conditional logic (IF/CASE), table calculations, sorting and indexing, filters and parameters, geographic visualisations, dashboard actions, and executive-focused dashboard design.

**Output:**

## The Dashboards
I built four Tableau dashboards for the business domains: Sales, Customer, Employee, and Product performance. Each dashboard was built with KPIs and consistent filters for functional analysis.

The Executive Sales Dashboard combines Total Revenue, Profit, and Customer metrics with monthly performance trends and state-level geographic analysis. Dynamic filters for year, state and car brand help targeted evaluation of regional performance and product contribution.

The Customer Dashboard focuses on demographic segmentation and purchasing behaviour. It highlights gender distribution, age group analysis, payment method preferences, and ranked top customers to support deeper understanding of demand patterns. The Employee Performance Dashboard evaluates salesforce impact through ranked views of sales volume and profit contribution, alongside commission tracking. The Product Dashboard identifies top-selling brands and most profitable car models using comparative and treemap visualisations, enabling quick assessment of product-level profitability and sales strength. Filters by year and state allow performance comparison across time and regions. 

The solution is built to function as an executive report, moving from high-level KPIs to detailed performance in a single framework.
